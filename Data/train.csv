1,@united awesome I'll book my next Christmas vacatinn this December any other ways you want to devalue mileage plus.
0,@united well someone should tell that to the employees at the Denver baggage claim. Still no bag!!!!
0,@united diverted and missed our connecting flight. Was just told that my bag is on it's way to MSY. If you only had people that cared
0,@united  Stressed and rude agents. Overwhelmed by delyd flight LAS-DEN 1657. Yelling at several people. Not pretty. This is #friendlyskies??
0,"@united also, the mere fact that I have to go online to issue a statement vice calling and talking to some directly is one good example."
1,@united thank you. I flew into Newark from Vail/Eagle.
0,@United now what?!? http://t.co/5hpSqVRjK8 flight was gone when I got off plane! #BusinessTravel #goodenoughmother
0,@united So you are inadequate by accident?
0,@united boarding time shows 35 min and your gate agent started at 45. showed up at 4:00 and they had to check bag. http://t.co/zCBJyo6lsN

2,"@united did you have seen my message today?? About a mcdonnell Douglas dc 10 model?? I will hear it if you read it, Goodnight now"
0,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
0,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
0,"@united cs thinks that miles can repair the damage done, it will be interesting if they travel in @united and exp the worst flight ever!"
2,@united I have a 0530 flight out of DFW on Tuesday. How far in advance will you give notice if Cancelled Flightled?
0,"@SouthwestAir doesn't charge ticket change fees. Do they not incur the same mysterious ""costs"" that you incur, @united?"
0,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
2,@united When will direct flights from Belfast Intl to Newark resume from their winter break? Thanks.
0,"@united rarely ceases to amaze...for the worse.  i hope this is the last time i ""have"" to fly with you."
2,"@united I need the phone number to baggage claim in LAX, my mom left her phone and someone called saying they would put it there but on"
2,"@United will not have to honor absurdly low mistake fares.
http://t.co/2Z3Jv73IlW v√≠a @usatoday"
0,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
2,"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
0,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
0,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
0,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
0,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
0,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
1,@united thank you
0,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
1,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
0,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
0,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
0,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
0,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt
1,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
0,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
0,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
0,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
1,@united Ok thank again for your help!
0,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
0,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
0,@united flight attendant doesn‚Äôt understand not understanding English doesn‚Äôt mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
0,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
1,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
0,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice

0,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
1,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp
0,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
0,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
0,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
0,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
0,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
0,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
1,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
2,@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
0,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK

1,@united Great! I'm ready to go home.
0,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
0,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
0,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
0,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member üòî
0,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
0,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
0,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
2,"@united After speaking to a United customer service rep the night before a flight, confirming that everything is ok with your reservation.."
0,@United has two whole people trying to schedule a flight's worth of missed connections. Shameful http://t.co/6kqLhVaP7G
0,@united we had four scheduled flights on this reservation and literally did not take one! Unreal
0,@united in ORD hotel issued to my 4yr old. Tickets needed fixing again another hour and 5 agents l8r nightmare still not over

0,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
0,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).

0,"@united they're not, actually. gate agent was so rude. now standing in a line waiting for reFlight Booking Problems. missed the only flight to STI. awful."
0,@united I'm not sure you can do anything as this has been building up over time! Other than promises from your CEO service has gotten worse!
0,"@united Cancelled Flightled my direct flight Newark-Brussels last night, now 7 hours behind schedule. In EU compensation would be a given, but in US?"
0,@united Making sure your flights aren't delayed due to poor maintenance would be a start.

0,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
0,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
0,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"
0,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"

0,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'

0,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
0,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
0,@united after 443min of avoidable non-weather delays that #Appreciation link better be giving out #GoldenTickets

0,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"

0,"@united I'm fully aware, it's just that your rules are harsh toward the client. Especially since you're going to resell my seat for more $."
0,@united why I won't check my carry on. Watched a handler throw this bag -- miss the conveyer belt -- sat there 10 min http://t.co/lyoocx5mSH
0,@united why? So I can waste more of time on this airline to get an automated message? Disappointing as always.
0,@united Terribly disappointed. Confirmed reservation delayed and your cust. service staff was not helpful in finding an alternate solution.
2,@united dmangen@visualclubconcepts.com
0,@united this is besides the fact that one week ago you delayed me by 18 hours. i am not impressed at all.
0,@united with the purchase of my ticket i am entitled to check in 1 bag however i am being charged an extra 25 dollars for domestic transport
0,"@united Thank U for the 1hr delay then boarding us onto a plane that reeks of vomit, flight attendant indicated it wasn't cleaned properly."
2,@united need to add service dog to my itinerary for tomorrow
0,@united just landed. Might want to check flight 304 plane from Houston. That sound was during takeoff &amp
0,"@united I requested an online refund option they denied saying the ticket was used, hope they understand the problem from your approach"

0,@united your customer service is crap.
1,@united mechanical issue. Looks like they got it fixed! Thanks for your concern.
0,@united UA1023 sitting on Tarmac at ORD when there are visibly gates open. Reassign our gate.
0,@united kind of unnerving to watch the guy deicing your plane text on his phone the whole time http://t.co/QdXfT9qqT9
0,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
1,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.
0,@united Thanks...seat made for a 6 year old and a broken TV. 20 flights/year...my last on your airline.
2,@united UA6357 needs de-icing! Stat! We've waited our turn...
2,@united yes I've boarded this way many times &amp
0,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.
0,@united why do I have to go thru the details of the flight I want w/ the recording to then repeat ALL when a real person gets on the line?
0,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
0,@united actually we aren't. Still parked here.
1,@united Thanks!
2,@united I looked on the email chain and there is not one
0,@united why the hell do my miles expire? Was really looking forward to accruing enough for a free flight in 10 years.

0,"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
0,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
0,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
0,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.
1,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
2,@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!

0,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"

0,@USAirways and @FlyKnoxville - bad weather should not be an excuse for not following established luggage procedures. #NoClothesNoInfo
0,@USAirways On hold for going on 40 minutes after spending 10 hours delayed in Denver cause of a broken plane. Thanks guys.
0,@USAirways @PhilaCarService looks like a long trip from cancun to philly? 9 hours Late Flight? Seriously?
1,@USAirways @AmericanAir Can you bring guinea pigs in small pet carrier onboard your flights?
0,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp
0,@USAirways It's very difficult to work with Baggage claims when they don't answer the phone
0,@USAirways I have better Intel than she does!  She said plane is due in at 630.  Flightaware and your own app say 645
0,"@USAirways should, but didn‚Äôt."
0,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
0,@USAirways very embarrassing.
0,@USAirways I‚Äôm still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isn‚Äôt up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... üòâ what about the impossible connection that started this?
0,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp
0,@USAirways and despite tailwind‚Ä¶ Will still be Late Flight.

2,@USAirways @VincesViews  there are significant number of folks on 686 connecting to 599 a few minutes hold would make many happy
0,@USAirways is anything being done to make Flight Attendants aware of AA member benefits? Embarrassing being argued with. Just happened.
0,"@USAirways @Gregm528 well there is certainly nothing happening ""in front"" of the scenes. #Noaccountability  #disappointing"
0,@USAirways 4 hours on tarmac in Charleston and still can't get a response after a week. Unacceptable
2,@usairways &amp
0,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
2,"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
0,@USAirways as far as being delayed goes‚Ä¶ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
0,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.

2,@USAirways is it your practice to give 1st class seats to us air employees before giving them to chairmans customers sitting in coach?
0,@USAirways would help if you flew bigger planes into TLH. All my team mates made it to the training but me.
0,@USAirways no I am trying to get on a plane from Phx to RNO and the gate is saying the flight was downgraded.
0,@USAirways She was put on hold on that number for a loooooong time too.  No help. #lostandforgotten
0,@USAirways I have never had a more unpleasant travel experience in my life. Now I might not get on my flight till tomorrow? This is insane

0,@USAirways is okay for u 2 Cancelled Flight change a flight when good 4 u but you cant logistically figure out what 2 do when a plane comes in on time
0,@USAirways if you actually cared about what you did it would be one thing. Sounds like you don't like being told how lousy your service is.
0,@USAirways you idiots kept an on time plane on the Tarmac for over an hour forcing us to not be there 10 minutes before.

0,@USAirways just an FYI I'll be writing registered letters 2 your ceo and those down the line 4 the shameful treatment and reactions we got.
0,@USAirways Don't blame it on weather. Rep at counter cost me entire day - not weather.  Printed Boarding Pass too Late Flight. #TakeResponsibility
0,@USAirways delays due to refueling are out of your control? If that's true I never want to fly US Airways again
0,@USAirways how about now getting us the rest of our bags please? We only received 2 of 5. Can you help with that?
1,"@USAirways - thanks, I hope so. Maybe you can put in a good word for me? ;-)"

0,@USAirways your a miserable airline and your loss of revenue is a reflection of that.  Go extinct.  A merger only delays the inevitable
0,@USAirways Like I thought this was America.  When did US Airways start operating under the rules of communist Russia?
0,@USAirways you guys should be nice and just give your routes to jet blue and southwest.  At least they treat their customers properly.
0,@USAirways I keep thinking this is a massive practical joke and someone is gonna appear out of thin air and take me to Reno tonight.
0,@USAirways I can legitimately say that I would have rather driven cross country than flown on US Airways.
0,@USAirways and despite the fact I see you answering all these people on twitter with mundane qs you refuse to answer me!
0,@USAirways is the worst airline to ever travel with.
0,@USAirways it still says that I can't check into my flight because the information is incorrect but everything is entered correctly

0,@AmericanAir aa223 being ignored
0,"@AmericanAir FYI twice now I've tried the ""we'll call you when someone is free"" thing. Both times it called, I picked up, then it hung up."

0,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
2,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
0,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
0,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....
1,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."

1,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
0,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"

0,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
1,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
0,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
0,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
0,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
2,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.

0,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded

2,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
1,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!

0,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
0,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
0,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt
0,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
0,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.

0,@AmericanAir ah if only we could get through. We've tried for over 2 hrs. Can we call @united?
0,@AmericanAir this is ridiculous! You all really have terrible customer service and a lack of urgency. Im convinced.
